Junqer is a simple python / pygtk application that targets a
series-junkie like myself.

== uses ==

  * pygtk
  * glade
  * gio

== limitations ==

  * currently only mplayer is available
  * almost everything is hardcoded
  * developed under/for? ubuntu 10.10
  * very messy code

== TODO ==

  * player backends (gstreamer/totem/vlc)
  * gui upgrades 
  * icon design
  * smarter "successor" / currently playing markup
  * save time when an episode stopped -> restart/resume half-played episodes  
  * player configuration
  * fullscreen management
  * play/pause/next/previous... actions
  * finish standby
  * some sort of testing / unit testing, whatever
  * make pychecker work correclty (lots of gtk-related errors)


hf!
